hello github!
i changes on github ,but in local repo not modified
and no any changes showing.
i am trying to some changes in github repo to check is its tracking or showing modified signal on local repo
<hello how are you>
<i am fine>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<want to show and update changes in local repo to remote repo >

after changes in remote repo always run this code <git pull origin main> to update on local repo.
otherwise, chnages will not show in local repo & it will create conflicts when we changes on local repo
and want to push on remote repo.
